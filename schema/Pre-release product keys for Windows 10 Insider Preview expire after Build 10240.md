This can be frustrating, especially if you want to try out the new features and improvements of Windows 10 before they are released to the public. Fortunately, there are some possible solutions that can help you fix this issue and activate your Windows 10 Insider Preview build with a pre-release product key.
 
## What are pre-release product keys for Windows 10 Insider Preview?

These product keys are different from the regular Windows 10 product keys that you use to activate your Windows 10 license. Pre-release product keys are only valid for a specific Windows 10 Insider Preview build and they expire when a new build is released.
 
You can get a pre-release product key for Windows 10 Insider Preview from the [Windows Insider Preview Downloads page](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windowsinsiderpreviewiso). You need to sign in with your Microsoft account that is registered as a Windows Insider and select the edition of Windows 10 that you want to download.

- You are using an outdated or incorrect pre-release product key. As mentioned earlier, pre-release product keys are only valid for a specific Windows 10 Insider Preview build and they expire when a new build is released. Therefore, you need to make sure that you are using the latest pre-release product key that matches the build that you have installed on your device.
- You are using a pre-release product key for a different edition of Windows 10. Pre-release product keys are also specific to the edition of Windows 10 that you have downloaded, such as Home, Pro, Enterprise, etc. Therefore, you need to make sure that you are using the correct pre-release product key for the edition of Windows 10 that you have installed on your device.
- You have entered the pre-release product key incorrectly. Pre-release product keys are case-sensitive and they contain alphanumeric characters. Therefore, you need to make sure that you have entered the pre-release product key exactly as it is shown on the Windows Insider Preview Downloads page, without any spaces or typos.
- You have reached the activation limit for your pre-release product key. Microsoft limits the number of times that you can use a pre-release product key to activate your Windows 10 Insider Preview build on different devices. Therefore, if you have already used your pre-release product key on multiple devices, you might not be able to use it again on another device.
- You have a network or firewall issue that prevents your device from connecting to the Microsoft activation servers. Pre-release product keys require an internet connection to activate your Windows 10 Insider Preview build. Therefore, if you have a network or firewall issue that blocks or interferes with your device's connection to the Microsoft activation servers, you might not be able to use your pre-release product key.
