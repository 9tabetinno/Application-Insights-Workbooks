One of the main strengths of this book is its interdisciplinary and comprehensive approach to nonverbal communication. The authors draw from various sources of research and theory to provide a balanced and updated overview of the field. They also integrate relevant examples and applications from different domains, such as education, health, business, law, politics, and media. The book covers both classic and contemporary topics in nonverbal communication, such as kinesics, proxemics, haptics, facial expressions, eye contact, paralanguage, and multimodal messages.
 
Another strength of this book is its readability and accessibility. The authors use clear and engaging language to explain complex concepts and phenomena. They also use humor and anecdotes to illustrate their points and keep the reader's interest. The book is well-organized and structured, with logical transitions and connections between chapters and sections.

A possible limitation of this book is that it may not cover all the aspects or perspectives of nonverbal communication that exist in the literature or in practice. Nonverbal communication is a vast and dynamic field that is constantly evolving and expanding. Therefore, it is impossible to include everything in one book. However, the authors do acknowledge this limitation and provide suggestions for further reading and research at the end of each chapter. They also encourage the reader to critically evaluate the information presented in the book and to apply it to their own experiences and contexts.
