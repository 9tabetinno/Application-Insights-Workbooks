- Select from a variety of predefined system types, such as combi systems, fresh water stations, air collectors, etc., or create your own custom system.
- Enter the location and consumption data for your project, and let the program suggest the optimal collector area and storage volume.
- Vary up to two parameters at the same time, such as collector area and storage volume, to find the best combination of target variables, such as efficiency, solar fraction, additional energy and solar yield.
- Simulate the system performance over a year with time steps of one to six minutes, and view the results graphically or numerically.
- Calculate the annual energy balance, CO2 savings, payback period and net present value of your system.
- Generate a comprehensive and appealing project report with all the system data, simulation results and profitability analysis.
- Access an extensive database of more than 4,000 collectors, 5,000 heat generators and 600 storage tanks from various manufacturers.

## What are the benefits of using T\*SOL Pro 5.0?
 
By using T\*SOL Pro 5.0, you can benefit from:

- A user-friendly interface that guides you through the design process with a design assistant and helpful tips.
- A reliable and accurate simulation engine that is based on decades of research and development by Dr. Valentin EnergieSoftware GmbH[^1^], a leading provider of software solutions for renewable energy systems.
- A flexible and versatile program that can handle complex systems with multiple heat sources and sinks, heat exchangers, pumps, controllers and sensors.
- A comprehensive and up-to-date database that is regularly updated with new products and data from manufacturers.
- A professional and convincing project report that can be used as evidence for subsidies or grants from authorities or institutions.

## How to use T\*SOL Pro 5.0 effectively?
 
To use T\*SOL Pro 5.0 effectively, you should:

- Read the user manual[^4^] carefully before starting your project, as it contains detailed instructions and examples on how to use the program.
- Use the design assistant to select the appropriate system type for your project, or create your own custom system if none of the predefined ones suits your needs.
- Enter realistic and accurate data for your location and consumption profile, as they have a significant impact on the simulation results.
- Use the parameter variation feature to compare different system configurations and find the optimal values for your target variables.
- Check the simulation results for plausibility and consistency, and use the graphic display to analyze the system behavior over time.
- Edit the project report according to your preferences and needs, and export it as a PDF or Word document.
