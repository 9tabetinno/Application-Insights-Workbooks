The movie has received mixed reviews from critics and audiences. Some have praised it for its bold and realistic portrayal of a complex and controversial issue, while others have criticized it for its dull and biased narrative. Some have also objected to the movie's depiction of the Tamil rebels as terrorists and villains, and accused it of being insensitive to the plight of the Sri Lankan Tamils.
 
The movie has been compared to Hollywood movies like Argo and Zero Dark Thirty, which also deal with historical events and covert operations. However, some critics have pointed out that Madras Cafe lacks the cinematic flair and suspense of those movies, and relies too much on exposition and voice-over. The movie also suffers from some weak performances, especially by Nargis Fakhri, who plays the journalist with a poor accent and limited expressions.
 
On the positive side, the movie has been lauded for its technical aspects, such as the sound design, cinematography, editing and background score. The movie also showcases some stunning locations in Sri Lanka and India, and recreates the period details with authenticity. The movie also benefits from John Abraham's earnest and restrained performance as the protagonist, who carries the movie on his shoulders.
 
Madras Cafe is not a typical Bollywood movie, but rather a brave and ambitious attempt to explore a dark chapter in Indian history. It is a movie that challenges the viewers to think and question, rather than entertain and please. It is a movie that deserves to be watched and discussed, rather than banned and ignored.
